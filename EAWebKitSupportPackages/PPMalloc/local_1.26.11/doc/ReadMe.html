<h1>ReadMe</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is PPMalloc</span></p>
<p>PPMalloc is a package that implements a suite of high performance C++
  memory allocation facilities. At the core of this suite is
  GeneralAllocator, which is a generalized memory allocator which
  replaces new/delete malloc/free and does a bit more as well. If all you
  want is GeneralAllocator, you need only one pair of files:
  EAGeneralAllocator.h/cpp. GeneralAllocator is a variant of the
  well-studied dlmalloc algorithm but includes many features beyond most
  general allocators, especially in the way of debugging support. See
  further below for description of these features.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Legal</span></p>
<p>PPMalloc is usable for all uses within Electronic Arts, both internally
  and in shipping products for all platforms. All source code was written
  by a single EA engineer and none of the source code comes from an
  external source. The primary algorithm of GeneralAllocator is based on
  the public domain dlmalloc algorithm and it has been confirmed with EA
  legal that there are no legality issues with this.<br>
