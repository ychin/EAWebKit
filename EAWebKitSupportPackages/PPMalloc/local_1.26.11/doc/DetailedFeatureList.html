  <p>For the purposes of those evaluating this package, we provide a detailed
  feature list for each of the PPMalloc modules. Further below we provide
  a list of features not included in PPMalloc and an explanation for why
  they aren't present.<br>
  <br>
  

  

  

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">GeneralAllocator / GeneralAllocatorDebug</span></p>
  <p>GeneralAllocator is a fully generalized allocator with no serious
  limitations. GeneralAllocatorDebug is a user-level debug layer over
  GeneralAllocator. We list GeneralAllocator and GeneralAllocatorDebug
  together because the latter is an extension of the former and they will
  almost always be used with the other in a development environment. For
  more information and example code, see <a href="GeneralAllocator.html">GeneralAllocator.html</a>.
  We use the term "core memory" here to refer to the large block of
  memory that an allocator uses as the source for user allocations.<br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Clean implementation<br>
</td><td style="vertical-align: top;">The header and source are very
clean and include no hacks or concessions. Dependencies are minimal, as
GeneralAllocator relies only on EABase. All public functionality is
documented in the header in Doxygen-friendly format. Comes with a good
set of heavy unit tests that test both simulation allocation behaviour
and real-world allocation behaviour.<br>
</td></tr>
<tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">High performance and efficiency<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocator is very
fast and very efficient. The primary algorithm is based on the
well-regarded dlmalloc algorithm but is futher improved.
GeneralAllocator runs at 5x-20x faster than most custom allocators in
use within EA. No allocator yet seen within EA has been as fast or as
scalable.<br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">High scalability<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocator scales very
well from small systems to large systems. In general, scaling is nearly
constant (O(1)) with respect the amount of memory or number of
allocations involved. This is unlike many other allocators which bog
down once the application goes beyond a few thousand concurrent
allocations, and large applications for the PC are already pushing a
million concurrent allocations while console applications of the future
will have similarly high requirements.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Minimal system allocation overhead<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">System
overhead per allocation is either 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the
allocation size. This is compared to 12 or 16 bytes of overhead found
in most allocators. When a 'tiny block' shim is used, the overhead for
small block sizes becomes zero.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Highly resistant to both internal and external fragmentation.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Internal fragmentation refers to
extra memory that is unused within an allocated, while external
fragmentatio refers to free blocks or space that in practice become
unavailable for use. GeneralAllocator's algorithm is resistant to both
types of fragmentation an university studies on GeneralAllocator's
brother, dlmalloc, confirm this. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Useful extra malloc variants, including MallocAligned, Realloc, MallocMultiple, Calloc.<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">In addition to the standard
Malloc, GeneralAllocator has MallocAligned which allows for an
allocation to be aligned to a user-specified value with an optional
offset to the requested aligned position. GeneralAllocator also has an
optimized Realloc which can very quickly shrink an allocation in place
and grow in place as well if possible. MallocMultiple allows the user
to request multiple guaranteed-contiguous blocks of equal or varying
size in a single call that has executes almost as fast as a single
allocation. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Includes high memory and end-packed memory options<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">High memory allocation is an
allocation option that requests the allocated block be stored in a more
permanent place so as to reduce external fragmentation.
GeneralAllocator supports the high memory option for all malloc
variants. End-packed memory is an option that requests that memory come
from as low as possible or high as possible in the heap in order to
reduce fragmentation at the cost of extra processing time. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Ability to create independent peer heaps and sub-heaps</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Unlike some allocators
GeneralAllocator is not hard-wired to be a "singleton". Multiple
concurrent instances of GeneralAllocator are possible and one instance
of GeneralAllocator can act as a sub-heap within another instance of
GeneralAllocator. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Portable to all current platforms and compilers<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocator is portable to
all current EA platforms, including PS2, PSP, XBox, GameCube, Windows,
Linux (various hardware), Macintosh OSX, and others. GeneralAllocator
compiles under all currently used compilers, including GCC, VC++, SN,
Intel, Metrowerks, and Borland. Portability includes 64 bit platforms
such as IA-64 and Power-PC64. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"> Savvy to platforms<br>
 </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocator isn't limited
or crippled to any least-common denominator platform. For example,
under Windows it will take advantage of memory mapping and virtual
memory reserve and commit operations. This allows for maximum
performance and flexibility on platforms that have extended
functionality. It also allows for GeneralAllocator to be a completely
arbitrary replacement for malloc/free new/delete for all types of uses
from tools to shipping applications. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Flexible heap reporting<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The heap can be walked by the
user via iteration or via a function callback. Additionally, the user
can take a snapshot of the heap state for storage and future analysis.
Filter flags allow the user to specify the types of blocks to be
iterated. Heap reporting forms the basis for the creation heap analysis
tools and is invaluable for analysis of runtime memory issues.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Allocation hooking<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Allocation hooks allow the user
to be notified of every user-level allocation operation, such as Malloc
and Free. For added flexibility, hooks come in both entry and exit
form, whereby the former is called before the allocation operation is
executed and the latter is called after execution. The hook gives the
user all information about the call, including the return value for
exit hooks.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Multi-level heap validation<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The heap structure can be
validated automatically every N operations or manually at any time via
the ValidateHeap function. Validation has multiple levels of checking
detail, from basic quick checking to fully comprehensive checking. If
some piece of code is trashing the heap, automatic or manually
sprinkled heap validation calls will find the culprit. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Optional thread safety<br>
</td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Enables use of the allocator in a
thread-safe way. GeneralAllocator has special thread safety
functionality which greatly improves thread-safe performance for slow
platforms such as PS2, which has slow semaphore locking.<br>
</td></tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Plug-innable assertion/trace output<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">User can redirect assertion and
trace output to the function of their choice, allowing integration with
the user's debug/trace system.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Extensive leak reporting output</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Memory leak trace output
includes detailed block information, including data preview, user debug
tags, file/line, allocation call stacks, etc. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Flexible core memory<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Can assign your own core memory
(the source for allocation) to GeneralAllocator or let it get it from
the system itself. Core memory can be added via multiple core blocks
and can be added at any time. Core memory can come from independent
sources and be of independent types.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Manual or automatic core expansion<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The user can manually
assign core; this is typically used on console and embedded platforms.
Additionally, the allocator can be enabled to automatically expand core
via operating system memory. This is typically used on PC, workstation,
and server platforms that have more advanced memory management systems
than smaller platforms. <br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Many compile time and runtime configurable options</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">There
are a number of compile-time options that tweak the functionality or
performance of GeneralAllocator and GeneralAllocatorDebug.
Additionally, there are a number of runtime options that tweak the
functionality or performance of these allocators.<br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Automated activity recording and playback.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Recording and playback of
allocation activity can be valuable in studying heap behaviour.
GeneralAllocator is recordable automatically via AllocationRecorder.
AllocationRecorder can playback recordings via GeneralAllocator or a
user-specified mechanism.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Extensive internal consistency checking<br>
</td><td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocator has very extensive
internal consistency checking which is enabled by default in a debug
build but is available if desired in a shippable build. Whether through
maintainence of the code or through user-caused damage of the heap, the
internal consistency very quickly finds the problem. <br>
</td></tr>
    <tr>

      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>
      </td>
    </tr>
<tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Flexible delayed frees<br>
      <br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Delayed frees refer to
behaviour whereby an allocator doesn't free memory when the user
requests but instead delays it for some time in order to help detect
certain kinds of application misbehaviour. GeneralAllocatorDebug has a
configurable delayed free mechanism with multiple policies, such as
count-based, time-based, and volume-based delays.</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Flexible guard fills (sentinels)<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug has
advanced guard fill (a.k.a. sentinel) functionality. Guard fills can be
of constant size or scaled to the size of the allocation with clamps on
min/max fill sizes. Guard fills are useful in detecting memory overruns
and random memory writes by application code.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Debug fills<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug
implements various kinds of memory fills to aid in detecting
application misbehaviour. These include including new fills, free
fills, delayed free fills, and guard fills.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Constant allocations</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug allows the
user to flag a memory block as constant and will verify that the
contents have not changed over the life of the allocation.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
<tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Pointer validation<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug has
built-in pointer validation. This is particularly useful for detecting
"multiple free" (whereby a block of memory is freed more than once)
bugs when they occur instead of later when the heap becomes corrupted. <br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Arbitrary data association<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug allows the
user to attach any data of any size to an allocation. This data can be
a pointer to other data or can be a block of arbitrary size. An number
of unique pieces of data can be associated with blocks; the user is not
limited to a single item. The user also has the option of storing this
data at any time and not just at the time that the allocation occured.
The user also has the option of storing this data within the allocated
block or separately from the allocated block.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
<tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Named allocations<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">A common technique for
tracking the usage of memory is to associate a name with an allocated
block. GeneralAllocatorDebug allows for named allocations. Names can be
unique to each block and don't have size limits.<br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">File/Line recording<br>
Call stack recording<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug has
the ability to store file/line information about an allocation as
commonly done with the C __FILE__ and __LINE__ defines. It also has the
ability to store full or partial call stacks for allocations as well,
for extended contextual information about the allocation. Both
file/line and callstack information can be done globally or just on the
blocks the user chooses.<br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Group recording<br>
</td><td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug has the
optional concept of allocation groups whereby it has an assignable
current group number and any allocations are assigned that group
number. A primary benefit is that the user can enter a new phase of the
application and change the group number and upon exiting that phase the
user can verify that no allocations exist with that group number. <br>
</td></tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Other per-block information<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">In addition to the
various items mentioned above, GeneralAllocatorDebug has the ability to
optionally automatically associate other pieces of information with
allocations, such as requested size, alignment, index, time, system
overhead, and thread id. <br>
</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Extensive metrics<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocatorDebug has
extensive metrics reporting facilities. You can query the number of
allocations, volume of allocations, volume of system overhead, total
historical allocation count, free count, etc. <br>

  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stack Allocator</span></p>
  <p>The StackAllocator is an allocator which allocates space via a
  pointer increment and is very fast at the cost of not being able to
  free arbitrary individual blocks.<br>

StackAllocator relies only on EABase (though you can enable it to use
GeneralAllocator). All public functionality is documented in the header
in Doxygen-friendly format. Comes with a fairly heavy unit test. </td></tr>
<tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Very fast allocation<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Allocation is about as
fast as an allocator can get, as it amounts to little more than an
alignment check and pointer increment in fast mode.<br>
</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">All conventional allocation styles<br>

</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Incremental allocation<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">With incremental allocation, you
can build an allocation incrementally instead of all at once. Building
an object incrementally is not the same as making multiple calls to
Malloc, as the latter aligns allocations whereas the former doesn't.
Also, the incremental allocation is faster as it has less to do.
Incremental objects are useful for building streams of data on the fly
and is also useful for building static string tables or similar tables
on the fly.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Fast mode / safe mode<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Allocations can be done in fast
mode, whereby no bounds check is done on the allocation space, and safe
mode, whereby an space check is done and core is expanded if needed.<br>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Plug-innable core memory<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Much like GeneralAllocator, StackAllocator lets you supply 'core'
memory for the allocator to work with. Multiple blocks of core are
supported; the allocator is not limited to a single contiguous core. <br>

templated by allocation class type, though it can also be used to
simply allocate memory of a given size.<br>

      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Malloc, MallocAligned, etc. are defined the same in HandleAllocator as
they are in GeneralAllocator, making the systems consistent with each
other. The mechanism to add and free core is also the same as GeneralAllocator.<br>

<p>Here we provide a list of features that PPMalloc doesn't have which you
  may have considered. For simplicity, the list is not broken down by
  module.<br>

    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">StackAllocator and FixedAllocator thread safety<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The StackAllocator and
FixedAllocator classes have no option to enable thread safety. This is
unlike the GeneralAllocator, GeneralAllocatorDebug, and HandleAllocator
classes, which have the option to be thread safe. <br>
</td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Adding thread safety is a
possibility for these classes and is open for consideration. In the
meantime, most uses for classes like these are specialized and thread
safety can often be implemented by&nbsp; the user of the class around
usage of the class instances. These allocators are much simpler than
GeneralAllocator and HandleAllocator and there is little or no special
benefit to internalizing thread safety to the class other than to
simplify its usage. <br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Generalized Fixed Allocator<br>
</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">There is no
FixedAllocator variant with takes an arbitrarily-sized allocation
request and allocates it from a large array of fixed sized bins.<br>
</td><td style="vertical-align: top;">This approach is sometimes seen
as an allocation strategy. It results in fast allocation speed at the
cost of memory wastage due to unused pool space. Studies have been done
on such allocators and they are in practice not much faster than
allocators such as GeneralAllocator but have significantly higher
memory usage due to the above-mentioned wastage. In a nutshell, you
don't wnat one of these allocators when instead you should just use
GeneralAllocator. <br>

    </tr><tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Ability to report X<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">PPMalloc doesn't have high-level
reporting functionality but instead only has the core functionality
upon which high-level reporting can be built.<br>
      <br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Various users have added customized reporting to their allocation
systems to support their specific needs. Each of these is unique to the
team or project. PPMalloc (the GeneralAllocator module in particular)
has rich support for reporting heap information to the user, but it
doesn't try to solve needs that are specific to individual projects. <br>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Advanced multi-threading support<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">GeneralAllocator doesn't have
specialized functionality for heavy multithreaded uses. If two threads
are very frequently using the same allocator, there is no advanced
functionality to improve performance. An example of such an allocator
is <a href="www.hoard.org">Hoard</a>.<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">For the great majority of EA
needs, there is little to be gained by specialized multithreading
support such as this. However, if it is ever deemed necessary,
GeneralAllocator can be extended to support such functionality.<br>
