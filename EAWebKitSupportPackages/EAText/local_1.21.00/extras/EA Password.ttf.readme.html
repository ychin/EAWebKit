<p><em>EA Password.ttf</em> is a tiny TrueType font which has only one glyph: &#9679; (Unicode char U+25CF)</p>
<p>This glyph is called &quot;Black Circle&quot; by the Unicode Standard, but its most common use is as a password glyph for use in password entry fields (e.g. [&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;]). In this font, the &#9679; glyph is assigned to Unicode char U+0000 and Unicode char U+0020 (i.e. space). The font has no glyphs assigned to any other characters. If you were to double-click this font on Windows you will notice that the font appears to have glyphs other than &#9679;. This is not true; Windows is pretending there are other glyphs where then are not. </p>
<p>There are two alternative ways to display passwords in EAText: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Use this font. EAText will recognize that the font has only the &#9679; glyph and will display all user keystokes with it. </li>
  <li>Set the TextStyle::mPasswordMode field to kPMPassword. This requires the font in use to have a &#9679; char, though it can have others as well. </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the <em>EA Password</em> font is not suitable for use in Windows as a password font for native Windows applications. The reason is that Windows (as mentioned earlier) has a policy of substituting any missing glyphs with glyphs from other fonts. So unless you have a font that assigns &#9679; to every possible Unicode point, Windows will substitute something.</p>
