  <h1>Understanding
  Character Sets</h1>
  <h3>What is a Character Set?</h3>
  <p>A character set is set of assignments
    of integers to characters. It is very common for us to think of the
    number 65 as referring to the letter 'A', but that&nbsp;isn't always
    the case. This concept is the most important thing
    to understand here and not understanding it is the biggest source of
    confusion about character sets. Also, by "character" we generally mean
"displayed glyph" and not the C++ "char" data type.</p>
  <h3>What is a Code Page?</h3>
  <p>A code page is for all
    practical purposes the same thing as a character set.</p>
  <h3>What is an Encoding?</h3>
  <p>An encoding is a way to
    represent character set values on a computer as a string of bytes. With
    ASCII encoding, encoded bytes are the same as character set bytes. But
    with encodings such as MBCS and UTF8, 1 character != 1 byte. </p>
  <h3>SBCS, MBCS, DBCS</h3>
  <p>SBCS means "Single Byte Character System"; each character is
    represented by one byte. MBCS
    means "Multi Byte Character System"; some characters are represented by
    one byte, while others are represented by two or more bytes. DBCS means
"Double Byte Character System" and is a kind of MBCS where characters
    are represented by at most two bytes. UTF8 (see below) is a kind of
    MBCS as well. </p>
  <h3>ASCII</h3>
  <p>ASCII is a simple SBCS character set
    whose name stands for "America Standard Code for Information
    Interchange". It has been around since the 1950s, but the last
    important version of it is the 1968 revision (ANSI X.3.4-1968). ASCII
    includes 128 characters with values of 0-127 (see the chart below).
    ASCII is useful for displaying English, but that's about it.</p>
  <h3>Extended ASCII</h3>
  <p>Extended ASCII is an SBCS character set that most properly
    describes the 1983 ANSI revision (ANSI_X3.110-1983) of ASCII. It
    includes ASCII plus another 127 characters from 128 to 255 (see the
    chart below). Extended ASCII is useful for displaying English
    and&nbsp;most Western European languages. It is the same as ISO 8859-1
    (below) but
    has some extra control characters.</p>
  <h3>ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1)</h3>
  <p>ISO 8859-1 is an&nbsp;SBCS character set similar to Extended
    ASCII. It is geared towards
    displaying characters useful for most&nbsp;Western European languages
    and not towards displaying&nbsp;symbolic characters. It is the
    character set that most&nbsp;unsophisticated
    web pages on the Internet use. There is an ISO 8859-2, -3, etc.
    but they are of little concern in the world of Unicode. </p>
  <h3>Unicode</h3>
  <p>Unicode is a "universal" character set that is effectively a
    superset of all other conventional character sets. As the Unicode web
    site says, "Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no
    matter what the platform, no matter what the program, no matter what
    the language." While the Unicode standard stands alone, it is for all
    practical purposes the same as ISO 10646; the two groups intentionally
    define these to be the same. The Unicode standard puts all characters
    into a 16 bit space, though room is left open for implementing more. An
    example of a font that may be on your Windows computer that has a very
    large percentage of glyphs from the Unicode character set is the 20MB
"Arial Unicode" TrueType font. See http://www.unicode.org for more.</p>
  <h3>UCS2, UCS4</h3>
  <p>UCS means "Universal Character Set". UCS2 simply means that you
    are using two bytes (uint16_t) to store a Unicode character. UCS2 is
    how Microsoft implements Unicode in Windows. Most Unix variants
    implement Unicode via UCS4, which means that 4 bytes (uint32_t) are
    used
    per character. Since the Unicode standard puts all characters into a 16
    bit character space,&nbsp;UCS4 is
    overkill for Unicode. </p>
  <h3>UTF8</h3>
  <p>UTF means "Unicode Transformation Format". UTF8 is an MBCS encoding of
    Unicode that is designed to be a superset of ASCII. The idea behind
    UTF8 is that string processing and parsing code that works with ASCII
    will work with UTF8 without modification. If you have an ASCII string,
    if could just as well be a UTF8 string. UTF8 adds the ability to store
    Unicode values as multi-byte sequences that involve byte values greater
    than 127. Thus, with UTF8, 1 byte sometimes equals 1 character set
    value and sometimes it doesn't. But either way, all UTF8 sequences map
    directly to Unicode characters; UTF8 is Unicode. Many web
    pages (especially Asian web pages) are implemented with UTF8 instead of
    ISO 8859-1.</p>
  <h3>UTF16</h3>
  <p>UTF16 is an encoding
    of Unicode that uses two bytes per character for nearly all
    characters. It leaves room at the very top to act like UTF8 and
    implement a multi-byte encoding for some characters. But hardly anybody
    uses those characters and thus UTF16 is for most uses the same thing as
    UCS2. </p>
  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <p>Q: Why is UTF8 used so often instead of
    UCS2? Windows NT/XP uses 16 bit characters&nbsp;("WCHAR") natively,
    right?<br>
    A: It's all about compatibility. There is a very large amount of
    existing code that implements one byte (Uint8) per character and it
    would be prohibitive to port it all to Uint16. The fact that Windows XP
    runs with UCS2 and has UCS2 APIs isn't
    enough to make it practical for many to use it. Windows 98 doesn't use
    UCS2, Unix and Macintosh don't use UCS2, and most third party tools
    you'll need to use don't use UCS2. So unfortunately, as great as UCS2
    is, it is impractical for many or most projects to use it.<br>
    <br>
    Q: Is Unicode really enough to hold all characters with 16 bits, or is
    it going to need to be revised some day to 32 bits?<br>
    A: Unless we start communicating with beings from another planet, 16
    bits will be enough. However, some scholars of classic Asian script
    have argued that there are many additional ancient Asian characters
    that have not been recognized by the Unicode standard.<br>
    <br>
    Q: What do I have to know in order to program with strings that are
    UTF8-encoded?<br>
    A: For all values &lt; 127, UTF8 strings are the same as ASCII, so any
    code that you have that looks for control characters or characters such
    as &lt;&gt;:?0^, etc. will work fine. However, you must remember that
    for values &gt; 128, one byte doesn't necessarily correspond to one
    glyph value. You will need a decoding function to decipher a UTF8
    string.<br>
    <br>
    Q: What' does the strlen() of a UTF8 string mean? Is it the number of
    bytes or the number of&nbsp;characters
    ("glyphs")?<br>
    A: It is the number of bytes. If you want to know how many characters
    (a.k.a. code points) a
    string has, you will
    need to apply a decoding function.<br>
    <br>
    Q: How do I convert characters between various character sets and
    encodings?<br>
    A: There are various encoding and decoding functions to convert between
    any recognized character set and encoding to any other. Unix-based
    platforms use the iconv API,
    while Windows uses the MultiByteToWideChar API. The Maxis Core
    framework has the ConvertEncoding function.</p>

    <p>The Unicode character set is too big to display here, but charts for the entire character set can be found at: <a
 href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">http://www.unicode.org/charts/</a>. Microsoft has a very expansive font called "Arial Unicode MS" that includes much of the Unicode character set. You can use this font and the Windows "Character Map" applet to navigate the Unicode character set. Lastly, the Framework documentation consists of a large Excel spreadsheet that includes every Unicode character, one per cell.</p>
