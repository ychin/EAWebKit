<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EAText is an advanced next-generation text characterization, layout, and font 
engine. </p>
<p>The biggest difference between EAText and other systems is that 
EAText supports all 
conceivable EA locales, including Western, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
and complex locales such as Thai, Hebrew, Hindi, and Arabic. This is the first 
time the problem of complex script layout has been universally solved within 
Electronic Arts and in doing so it should help lower one of the most significant 
barriers to multi-locale development. By using EAText, you automatically get support for 
about 25 languages in your game. This support includes basic layout and display, HTML/styled 
display, and interactive text editing. EAText additionally comes with a set of 
basic pipeline tools that can be used with EAText but can also be used with 
other systems due to their pipeline/engine-neutral design. Lastly, EAText and 
its associated packages follow standards such as Unicode, CSS, and XHTML, so 
expectations and behavior follow well-known conventions.</p>
<p>There are some packages within EA that have overlapping functionality with 
EAText. Most prevalent among these is the rwfont package. EAText does not seek to 
replace or compete against these packages but rather it attempts to provide 
augmented functionality for users that have a need for its features. Much of the 
EAText library and associated tools were written in such a way as to be agnostic 
to the underlying rendering package and so can mix with other related packages.</p>
<p>Many examples here show pictures of text in various EA games. In most cases 
these examples were done with text layout against screenshots of the game and 
were not done by modifying the game itself to display the text.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This document provides a graphical introduction to many of EAText's features. 
A summary of the primary features is as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Scalable functionality; advanced features can be compiled away if desired. 
Users with lower requirements &quot;pay&quot; only for what they need. Much of the 
functionality listed below is optional and goes away if it's not used. Also configuration #defines allow for functionality stripping as well. </li>
	<li>Cross-platform portable. Runs the same on all platforms, including advanced 
script layout. </li>
	<li>Supports all conceivable languages EA could ship to within the next ten 
	years; see below for a detailed listing.</li>
	<li>Supports complex script composition and layout features, such as:<ul>
		<li>Bidirectional layout (e.g. Hebrew, Arabic). </li>
		<li>Contextual shaping (e.g. Thai, 
		Hindi, Arabic). </li>
		<li>Combining characters.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Simple high level API (Typesetter). Drawing a line of plain 
text at the application level can be done with a single line of C++ code. </li>
	<li>Provides a fast ASCII layout option for non-localized (e.g. debug) text.</li>
	<li>Reasonably high performance. Low memory usage, including little or no runtime memory allocation. 
	</li>
	<li>Fast 
execution, including the ability to create and save pre-built display lists.</li>
	<li>Fast startup. Supports the pre-loading of glyphs from disk. </li>
	<li>TrueType and OpenType font support (via Font 
Fusion, and thus Japanese Stroked Font support). </li>
	<li>Bitmapped font support (and 
thus multi-colored font support). </li>
	<li>Supports polygonal fonts, for true 3D fonts (flat or extruded). </li>
	<li>Supports contour fonts -- outlined fonts.</li><li>Supports multiple scripts and fonts within a 
line of text arbitrarily, allowing not just for HTML but also for overcoming 
font glyph support problems.</li>
	<li>Supports the CSS standard and comes with an 
optional CSS-compliant in-game font server. </li>
	<li>Supports advanced layout features such as ellipsizing, box-fitting, 
	picking, justification, wrapping modes, underlining, highlighting, and password display/entry.</li>
	<li>Comes with an optional style 
engine so an application can work with styles instead of hard-coded fonts.</li>
	<li>Supports the Unicode standard with respect to 
text characterization and layout. </li>
	<li>Supports Unicode compliant locale-proper string sorting (collation) and 
	normalization.</li>
	<li>Supports line breaking options as per the CSS standard.</li>
	<li>Supports curved/Bezier path following (text along an arbitrary curve).</li>
	<li>Includes generic Unicode-proper char/word/sentence/line/paragraph break iterators. 
	</li>
	<li>Supports locale-proper left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, and 
	justified text; plus vertical alignment.</li>
	<li>Provides basic dynamically generated text effects 
	functionality (shadow, outline, raise).</li>
	<li>Comes with support for standards-compliant XHTML parsing and rendering 
	via the XHTML package.</li>
	<li>Comes with generic interactive multi-line multi-language text editor 
	which can be adapted to any GUI system.</li>
	<li>Comes with BitmapFontEditor, an advanced multicolor/bitmapped font 
	generator and WYSIWYG editor.</li>
	<li>Comes 
with a font WYSIWYG preview tool (EATextViewer) that lets you tinker with fonts 
and styles on the target platform.</li>
	<li>Allows for relatively easy porting to different rendering systems (six 
	as of this writing).</li>
</ul>
<h2>EAText Metrics</h2>
<p>EAText largely follows the established conventions of typography. There is no 
definitive standard for typographical metrics, though there is little 
disagreement on the topic. We present font metrics and glyph metrics 
respectively as defined by EAText. Font metrics are metrics that describe the 
entire font, whereas glyph metrics describe individual glyphs. </p>
<p><b>Font Metrics</b></p>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Glyph Metrics</b></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/GlyphMetrics.png" width="424" height="369"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Complex Script</h2>
<p>Western languages uses scripts (writing systems) that are mostly 
straightforward in their layout rules. Each stroke of the user's keyboard 
corresponds to a single glyph on the screen to the right of the previous glyph. 
Space separates words and punctuation ends sentences. The left arrow key moves 
the cursor to the glyph to the left and the backspace key deletes the glyph to 
the left. However, this doesn't quite apply to some scripts, and we call such 
scripts <i>complex</i>.</p>
<p><b>Bidirectionality</b></p>
<p>Some scripts such as Hebrew are right-to-left (RTL) instead of left-to-right 
(LTR), and thus the text starts on the right and each appended character is on 
the left. Additionally, when numerals or Western script is used with RTL script, 
they are ordered LTR within the RTL text. This is called bidirectionality, or 
bidi for short. And when characters such as (), [], or “” are used in such 
bidirectional text they need to be graphically reversed by the layout engine. 
Let's look at a few examples.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Typing order (left) and display order (right) of Hebrew embedded into 
	English<br>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/HebrewReorder1.png" width="624" height="60"></p>
	<p>Hebrew embedded into English embedded into Hebrew<br>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/HebrewReorder2.png" width="963" height="76"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are additional problems encountered beyond re-ordering, such as glyph 
mirroring, punctuation placement, justification, character affinity, etc. A 
thorough discussion of these problems is outside the scope of this document. </p>
<p><b>Substitution</b></p>
<p>Some scripts require the displayed glyphs to be different from the characters 
the user typed, depending on their context within a line of text. In addition to 
being RTL, Arabic is a cursive script (i.e. like handwriting) and requires the 
displayed text to be smoothly connected, like you connect characters when 
handwriting. To implement this on a computer using discrete glyphs requires <i>
contextual substitution</i>. Additionally, Arabic has required ligatures; recall 
that a ligature is the combining of two glyphs into a single glyph. We'll 
provide a few simple examples here.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Arabic contextual substitution<br>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/ArabicSubstitution.png" width="487" height="52"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Positioning</b></p>
<p>Some scripts require that the displayed glyphs be positioned on screen in a 
particular location relative to other glyphs instead of simply being in the same 
location after the previous glyph. Thai and Hindi are two languages which 
require custom glyph positioning lest their text be odd looking or illegible. We 
provide a couple examples to graphically describe this situation.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Thai glyph positioning<br>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/ThaiPositioning.png" width="275" height="60"></p>
	<p>Hindi glyph positioning<br>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/HindiPositioning.png" width="216" height="47"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Locale Support </h2>
<p>EAText supports layout and interactive editing in 28 languages from 9 
scripts, including:</p>
<blockquote>
	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<td>Arabic (bidirectional)</td>
			<td>French</td>
			<td>Italian</td>
			<td>Russian</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Chinese</td>
			<td>German</td>
			<td>Japanese (kanji, hiragana, katakana)</td>
			<td>Spanish</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Czech</td>
			<td>Greek</td>
			<td>Korean</td>
			<td>Swedish</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Danish</td>
			<td>Hebrew (bidirectional) </td>
			<td>Norwegian</td>
			<td>Thai (complex composition and breaking) </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Dutch</td>
			<td>Hindi (complex composition) </td>
			<td>Polish</td>
			<td>Tagalog</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>English</td>
			<td>Hungarian</td>
			<td>Portuguese</td>
			<td>Turkish</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Finnish</td>
			<td>Icelandic</td>
			<td>Romanian</td>
			<td>Vietnamese</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</blockquote>
<p>Some scripts are easier to support than others, with the bidirectional and 
complex scripts being particularly difficult. Here we present some EAText renderings of 
a few of the more esoteric scripts.</p>
<p><b>Korean </b>script -- known as Hangul script -- is a highly organized 
phonemic alphabet organized into syllabic blocks. Interactive editing of Hangul 
requires an IME (input method editor) which composes building block consonants 
and vowels (jamo) into glyphs.
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Thai </b>is a complex script known for its vertical glyph composition 
whereby decorations are dynamically applied to glyphs in positions that depend 
on the glyphs and other decorations. Thai is also unique because it doesn't 
separate words by spaces and doesn't delimit sentences with punctuation (note 
the picture below). Line 
breaking during layout needs to be done by dictionary lookup or by invisible 
characters. Thai decorations are vertically stacked upon base glyphs, with a 
result of this being that Thai requires more vertical space than most other 
scripts.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/ThaiText.png" width="494" height="185"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Hebrew</b> is a right-to-left script which is noted for lacking vowels in 
most informal usage. While Hebrew is a right-to-left script, embedded 
left-to-right script and numbers must be rendered left-to-right inline with the 
right-to-left Hebrew. While Western GUIs and their text are left-aligned, Hebrew 
GUIs and text are right-aligned.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><b>Arabic</b> is a cursive script (i.e. like handwriting), and its displayed 
glyphs and their connections must be chosen by the layout engine based on their 
relative positions combined with OpenType information associated with the font. 
Arabic is a right-to-left script but embedded Western script and numbers must be 
rendered left-to-right, as we can see in the example below.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/ArabicDemo.png" width="913" height="245"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Hindi</b> (Devanagari script) is noted for its beautiful text and raised 
baseline. The selection of the appropriate glyphs and their positioning must be 
done by the layout engine based on the context of the text combined with 
OpenType information associated with the font.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/HindiDemo.png" width="700" height="525"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>TextEdit</h2>
<p>Interactive text editing is a common task in PC-based games and an occasional 
task on console-based games. It is one of the more difficult things to do 
properly in a GUI, especially in the face of localization. As a result, many 
games shy away from the problem by providing minimal text creation or editing 
features in their games. EAText solves this problem and makes it relatively easy 
for any game to implement text editing, as it comes with a generic multi-line 
text editor that is independent of the rendering system and can be plugged into 
any application. With it you get proper localized support for text editing in 
all of the languages listed earlier. Think of it as being a fully abstracted 
&quot;owner-draw&quot; text editing widget.</p>
<p>Here's a listing of TextEdit's primary features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Supports all EAText scripts and languages.</li>
	<li>Multiple languages can be simultaneously represented within a TextEdit.</li>
	<li>Supports single or multi-line editing.</li>
	<li>Supports horizontal and vertical scroll bars at the user's option.</li>
	<li>Supports proper localized password entry mode.</li>
	<li>Provides a text length limit option.</li>
	<li>Provides undo/redo of an user-specified limit.</li>
	<li>Supports right-to-left or left-to-right base paragraph directions.</li>
	<li>Supports proper bidirectional layout and editing.</li>
	<li>Can substitute alternative fonts when text is not representable by the 
	base font.</li>
	<li>Supports any kind of font that EAText supports, which may include 
	user-defined font types.</li>
	<li>Supports traditional 2D editing as well as 3D editing in the game world.</li>
	<li>Supports IME (input method editing) via the associated EAIME package.</li>
	<li>Can be used in read-only mode as a text display.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a 2D scrolling TextEdit showing some highlighted text:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Here's a TextEdit being used interactively with a terrain view:</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>Fast Mode</h2>
<p>EAText has &quot;fast mode&quot; layout functionality for implementing debug HUDs. In 
this mode there is no advanced layout and instead characters are simply placed 
one after another in a tight programming loop. This is useful for non-localized 
needs such as frames-per-second counters, on-screen debug traces, single lines 
of Western text, etc. Here we show an example of a debug stats HUD done via 
the fast mode functions.</p>
<blockquote>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/BlackHUD.png" width="800" height="397"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>XHTML</h2>
<p>EAText supports locale-proper advanced layout such as HTML. The XHTML package 
is a separate package which implements a standards-compliant XHTML/CSS parsing 
and display engine using EAText. XHTML is the most modern form of HTML and is the direction 
the W3C standardization committee is going. While XHTML is best known for 
describing web pages presented by web browsers, it can also be used to display a 
richer gaming interface, especially interfaces with dynamic content.</p>
<p>The following is a somewhat unrefined demo of XHTML capabitilities, but it serves the purpose of demonstrating some of its capabilities.</p>
<blockquote>
	<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/XHTMLDemo1.png" width="577" height="329"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below we have a pre-shipping example of XHTML as used in EA's Spore game. The view consists of XHTML dynamically downloaded by the game from a conventional HTTP server. The view below is essentially an in-game web browser displaying content authored on the server by conventional tools and formats. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/XHTMLSpore.png" width="724" height="604"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bitmapped Fonts</h2>
<p>In addition to TrueType fonts, EAText supports bitmapped fonts. A bitmapped 
font is one based on custom-made bitmaps as opposed to TrueType's scalable 
outlines. The primary advantage of bitmapped fonts is that they can be 
multicolored with arbitrary alpha (i.e. ARGB) as opposed to being limited to 
monochrome with edge alpha. The primary disadvantage of bitmapped fonts is that 
they use more memory and don't scale in size well.</p>
<p>The following should help convey the difference between outline and bitmapped 
fonts, respectively:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/Glow.png" width="684" height="540"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A primary use of bitmapped fonts is to embed symbols or pictures inline with 
text, such as controller button
<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/ControllerSymbol.png" width="18" height="18"> 
symbols. This makes things easy because the pictures are treated like 
characters, and thus no extra effort
<img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/Smiley.png" width="15" height="15"> is required by 
the programmer or artist. </p>
<p>With EAText you can use bitmapped fonts mixed with TrueType fonts. Because 
EAText layout is style-based instead of font-based, setting up the display or 
editing of mixed outline/bitmapped fonts requires little effort on the part of 
the programmer or artist.</p>
<h2>Dynamic Text Effects</h2>
<p>EAText supports some basic common text effects dynamically. By dynamically we mean that the effect is synthesized at runtime algorithmically as opposed to being done at production time with a bitmapped font. While dynamic effects have a runtime execution cost, they can save memory due to creating only what's needed. These text affects are implemented per-glyph as opposed to per layout and thus they have some limitations that are best overcome by doing layout level effects (e.g. double line rendering).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>outline<br>
  <img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/TextOutline.png" width="138" height="37">  </p>
  <p>shadow<br>
  <img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/TextShadow.png" width="123" height="35">  </p>
  <p>emboss<br>

</blockquote>
<p>The above effects are not done by EAText; they are Photoshop mockups. EAText has these options but as of this writing (January 2007) the options don't look as nice as they should and are scheduled to be revised.</p>
<h2>Layout Options</h2>
<p><b>Alignment</b></p>
<p>EAText supports the usual set of alignment options with plain text, styled 
text and interactive text editing. This functionality is properly implemented 
across all scripts, including cursive scripts such as Arabic. We display some horizontal alignment options here, but EAText also does vertical aligment as well. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/AlignmentDemonstration.png" width="643" height="218"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Ellipsizing</b></p>
<p>One of the options provided is line-level and paragraph-level ellipsizing, 
whereby ellipsis are automatically laid out with the text appropriately for all 
languages.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/Ellipsis.png" width="700" height="349"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Highlighting</b></p>
<p>EAText can provide highlighting information, which allows correct highlighting of text by the rendering system. This is useful in an interactive text editing environment and is used by the TextEdit component of EAText. This feature is not trivial, as highlighted text can have no self-overlapping regions (the user may be drawing with alpha) and the highlighted ranges may be discontiguous in the presence of bidirectional text.</p>
<p>The following consists of a contiguous selection. Really. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/HighlightHebrew.png" width="660" height="62"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try it for yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Hebrew author wrote, &quot;&#1513;&#1508;&#1503; &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1511;&#1510;&#1514; &#1490;&#1494;&#1512; &#1489;&#1496;&#1506;&#1501; (yes, lettuce) &#1495;&#1505;&#1492;, &#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&quot; and I realized later that it was a pangram.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overlapping glyphs should contribute to highlight alpha only once:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/HighlightThai.png" width="518" height="36"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Underlining</b></p>
<p>EAText can provide underline layout, which allows correct underlining of text by the rendering system. This is most useful for PC titles that implement hyperlinks in-game. This feature is not quite as simple as it may seem, as glyphs may be overlapping and underlined ranges may be visually discontiguous in bidirectional environments. </p>
<p><b>Owner draw</b></p>
<p>EAText allows the user to implement owner-draw objects inline with the text without having to resort to using full-blown XHTML. The objects use the same glyph metrics as do text glyphs and so are not limited to sitting on the baseline. The user can assign basic properties to objects in order to control their word- and line-breaking properties. Here we show two objects owner-drawn and a lightning post-effect linking them. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/OwnerDrawObjects.png" width="688" height="394"> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Password shaping</b></p>
<p>EAText implements password display and interactive entry without the 
programmer or font artist do any work, as is commonly needed for this. To use 
password display with EAText/Typesetter, just enable the TextStyle password 
option and it does the rest. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img border="0" src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/PasswordEntry.png" width="700" height="373"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Line wrapping</strong></p>
<p>EAText supports the following line breaking modes which follow the CSS3 text-wrap standard:</p>
<ul>
  <li>normal - text is wrapped at proper break locations as defined by the Unicode standard.</li>
  <li>none - text is not wrapped at all but instead overflows its boundary.</li>
  <li>unrestricted - text may break between glyph clusters (within words).</li>
  <li>hard (no longer part of CSS) - text may break outside of its boundary but only at valid break locations. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Character and line spacing</b></p>
<p>EAText allows the user to explicitly control character spacing (tracking) and 
line spacing. Here we have some text laid out with variable character spacing 
settings. </p>
<blockquote>
	<p><img src="http://eaos.rws.ad.ea.com:8080/@md=d&c=And@//EAOS/UTF/DL/_docs/EAText/Images/Character%20Spacing.png" width="358" height="321"></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Curved text</b></p>
<p>EAText allows you to lay out text along the inside or the outside of an 
arbitrary user-defined curve. A Bezier mode comes built-in, and a simple Bezier 
was used to generate the picture below. A common in-game use would be to flow 
text around a logo, put text on players' jerseys, place text on a curving road, 
etc.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2>BitmapFontEditor</h2>
<p>The BitmapFontEditor (BFE) is a WYSIWYG editor for multi-colored bitmapped 
fonts. It is flexible with respect to the font file format it works with, as it 
is independent of any private or proprietary binary standards. The font metrics 
consist of a text file and the font graphics consist of open standard graphics 
formats such as .png, .tga, or anything else gimex.dll can read/write. 
Developers are expected to convert these graphics files to optimized 
platform-specific formats as part of the build process. It is not up to 
BitmapFontEditor to try to decide what's best in this respect for teams.<br>
<br>
BFE is a typographically proper implementation of a font generator and editor. 
All aspects of editing are available via the GUI and it has the following basic 
feature set: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Open file format. Header is text and textures are any of the common 
	bitmap types, such as png, tga, etc. The result is that users can use their 
	conventional pipelines to convert the textures into whatever optimized 
	format they want. Nobody is tied to a proprietary system. </li>
	<li>Portable implementation which has no dependencies on external libraries. 
	The TrueType converter -- &quot;BitmapFontGenerator&quot; (BFG) --&nbsp;itself is a 
	standalone applet which uses Font Fusion. </li>
	<li>Font&nbsp;properties are CSS-proper and savvy. </li>
	<li>Can&nbsp;generate a font&nbsp;from an outline font (e.g. TTF) or from simply a 
	texture generated by Photoshop or another source.&nbsp;Typically the font 
	graphics will be developed in Photoshop while the metrics are set in 
	BitmapFontEditor.</li>
	<li>The BitmapFontGenerator can be script 
	driven and automated. </li>
	<li>Outline font generation comes with many features, such as face index, 
	size, dpi, stretch, texture size spec, padding size, smoothing, kerning, 
	ligatures, shadow, outline, raised, depressed effects, character selection 
	via file or char picker, etc. </li>
	<li>Automatic glyph outline detection during glyph creation. Just 
	double-click in the center of the glyph. </li>
	<li>Texture view with zoom and scroll and user-selectable background color 
	or bitmap (e.g. game screen or GUI). </li>
	<li>Ability to add and remove textures from the texture set dynamically 
	during editing. </li>
	<li>Kerning support, both import and editing. Kerning is properly done at 
	the glyph level and not the character level. </li>
	<li>Ligature support, both import and editing. Ligatures are properly done 
	at the glyph level as well as the character level. </li>
	<li>Proper char mapping, whereby multiple chars can be mapped to the same 
	glyph for memory savings with mixed locales. </li>
	<li>Automatic detection of texture file changes (e.g by Photoshop) during 
	editing, with automatic reload.&nbsp;Thus artists can tweak the glyphs while 
	working on the font. </li>
	<li>Text preview, WYSIWYG, with color or textured (e.g. from GUI) 
	background. </li>
	<li>Unicode-savvy and proper. </li>
	<li>Multiple texture support. </li>
	<li>GUI glyph editor with draggable glyph and font metrics. Arbitrary zoom 
	and scroll as well. </li>
	<li>Much context menu support. </li>
	<li>Realtime editing updates across all views. </li>
	<li>Character mapper with hex and Unicode standard character descriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>BitmapFont examples</b></p>
<p>Here we present a small collection of bitmapped fonts created with 
BitmapFontEditor (graphics by Photoshop). A couple of these may be slightly over-the-top, but they represent real things you can do with ARGB fonts. </p>

<h2>PolygonFontGenerator</h2>
<p>EAText supports 3D polygonal text generated from an arbitrary TrueType font 
with various parameters via PolygonFontGenerator. User-supplied glyph models can 
be used as well, but can still be laid out by the EAText Typesetter. EAText 
baseline curve fitting can be applied to polygonal text the same as textured 
text.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Large on-screen text without the excessive texture memory usage Animated 
	text above avatars, waypoints, etc.</li>
	<li>Personalization of in-world entities</li>
	<li>Dynamic (e.g. localized) text on in-game objects Proper dynamic 
	placement of in-game signs that have previously been fixed and pre-composed.</li>
	<li>Can use the text geometry to do effects that can't be done with a 
	textured quad.</li>
</ul>
<p>PolygonFontGenerator converts a TrueType font (outline font) to a polygonal 
representation suitable for rendering with 3D graphics operations. This is as 
opposed to the traditional method of converting an outline font to a bitmapped 
representation at runtime. </p>

<h2>ContourFontGenerator</h2>
<p>ContourFontGenerator creates fonts that are defined not by polygons but by 
their outlines as line segments. You can do various effects with this such as 
treating the outline contour as a path. The following is an example of how a 
pixel shader might implement a stroked path along a ContourFont. ContourFont is 
new for EAText and doesn't yet have an elaborate demo, so we make a nifty 
picture here with Photoshop to suggest a possibility.</p>

</blockquote>
<h2>EATextViewer</h2>
<p>The EATextViewer tool is a tool that lets artists, producers, and programmers 
rapidly preview text of a variety of fonts and styles in WYSIWYG form.</p>
<p>The app shown below is a Windows app, but the tool runs natively on XBox 360 
and PS3 as well (native Wii not available yet), so you can get a WYSIWYG view 
directly on the target platform. A couple of the options shown below haven't 
been implemented in the viewer yet, but that will be rectified. The GUI below 
looks like a Windows GUI, but actually it's a UTFWin GUI designed to mimic 
Windows. The four text large boxes at the bottom are text editors. You need to 
connect your mouse and keyboard to your 360 and PS3 if you want to use the app 
interactively on those platforms. </p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>A comprehensive discussion of benchmarks is outside the scope of this document and would be more suitable for a technical document. Nevertheless, users would probably like to know how fast EAText  is and how much memory it uses. It turns out that neither of these have a simple answer, as the performance and memory usage of EAText depends on how you set its configuration options and how you use it. We present a few bulleted statements on the topic here:</p>
<ul>
  <li> EAText is probably fast enough for most localized and non-localized uses. Unless you are displaying hundreds of characters which are changing on the screen frequently, you will likely not notice EAText's processing. </li>
  <li>EAText allocates no memory while running, assuming the user sets up things like fonts and buffers up front.</li>
  <li>A couple kilobytes of static tables are used by various functions; how much memory they use depends on the configuration. </li>
  <li> A flexible dynamic glyph cache is provided and uses DXT compression by default.</li>
  <li>Single line layout is significantly faster than multi line layout.</li>
  <li>The fast text layout functions are significantly faster than the regular functions but provide little localization support. </li>
  <li>Complex script layout (e.g. Thai, Hebrew, Arabic) takes significantly more time than regular localized layout. </li>
  <li>Layout modifiers such as the text-along-a-curve feature are optional and take extra time on top of regular layout, as they are a post-process.</li>
  <li>As of this writing, there are multiple optimization opportunities that haven't been taken yet. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here we provide some basic benchmark results of character throughput under various configurations and platforms. The numbers here highly dependent on a number of factors, but should provide rough figures to go by. Note that the measurements are for drawing 1000 characters, which is at least an order of magnitude greater than most games need to layout at a time. These benchmarks will improve when additional optimization is implemented. </p>
