<h1>EAFileNotification</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EAFileNotification detects file system changes as they occur. This is useful for having asset management systems whereby you want to detect changes during development time. It's also useful for implementing user plug-in systems whereby you want to detect that the user has added something at runtime.</p>
<p>EAFileNotification works on all platforms, even if the platform doesn't have native support for automatic file change detection. However, it works more efficiently on those platforms which have automatic detection. </p>
<h2>Example usage </h2>
<p>Here is some basic example usage of FileChangeNotification via a fictitious AssetManager class: </p>
<pre class="code-example">class AssetManager
{
public:
    void Init()
    {
        mFCN.Init();
        mFCN.SetWatchedDirectory(L"/app/data/");
        mFCN.SetChangeTypeFlags(FileChangeNotification::kChangeTypeFlagModified);
        mFCN.SetOptionFlags(FileChangeNotification::kOptionFlagWatchSubdirectories);
        mFCN.SetNotificationCallback(StaticNotification, this);
        mFCN.Start();
    }

    void Shutdown()
    {
        mFCN.Shutdown();
    }

	static void StaticNotification(FileChangeNotification* pFCN, const char16_t* pDirectoryPath,<br>                                   const char16_t* pFileName, int nChangeTypeFlags, void* pContext)
    {
        return static_cast&lt;AssetManager*&gt;(pContext)-&gt;Notification(pFCN, pDirectoryPath, pFileName, nChangeTypeFlags);
    }

	void Notification(FileChangeNotification* pFCN, const char16_t* pDirectoryPath,<br>                      const char16_t* pFileName, int nChangeTypeFlags, void* pContext)
    {
        // Do something here.
    }

protected:
    FileChangeNotification mFCN;
}; </pre>
<h2>Interface</h2>
<p>FileChangeCallback</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-example-comment">/// FileChangeCallback
///
/// Defines a callback function the user supplies for notification callbacks.
/// Do not save the directory path or file name pointers beyond this call.
/// Note that directory paths in this EAFile/EADirectory system are defined as
