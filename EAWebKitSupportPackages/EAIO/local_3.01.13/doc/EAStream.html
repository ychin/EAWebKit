<h1>EAStream</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EAStream is the core IO interface for all of UTF. It consists of typedefs, enumerations, and the IStream interface class. </p>
<p>The IStream class looks like this: </p>
<pre class="code-example">class IStream
{
public:
    virtual          ~IStream();
    virtual int       AddRef() = 0;
    virtual int       Release() = 0;
    virtual uint32_t  GetType() const = 0;
    virtual int       GetAccessFlags() const = 0;
    virtual int       GetState() const = 0;
    virtual bool      Close() = 0;
    virtual size_type GetSize() const = 0;
    virtual bool      SetSize(size_type size) = 0;
    virtual off_type  GetPosition(PositionType positionType) const = 0;
    virtual bool      SetPosition(off_type position, PositionType positionType) = 0;
    virtual size_type GetAvailable() const = 0;
    virtual size_type Read(void* pData, size_type nSize) = 0;
    virtual bool      Flush() = 0;
    virtual bool      Write(const void* pData, size_type nSize) = 0;
};</pre>
<p>Most of this document will revolve around the discussion of the IStream class. </p>
<h2>Design considerations</h2>
<p>The following are class-wide design considerations. Per-function issues are discussed in the function documentation itself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The I in IStream means C++ <em>interface</em> and doesn't mean <em>input</em>; it's a common pattern in C++ interface design to prefix interface classes with an I like this. </li>
  <li>The intent behind IStream is to provide a single interface for all fundamental IO operations.</li>
  <li>Basic IStream implementations such as FileStream and MemoryStream are provided by the UTF. </li>
  <li>Implementors can write custom implementations of the IStream interface for their subsystems.</li>
  <li>IStreams can be <a href="EAStreamAdapter.html">adapters</a> for other IStreams. By this we mean, for example, that a utility class can dynamically wrap around an IStream interface (through ownership, not inheritance) and filter the IO request to do something useful such as endian swapping. </li>
  <li>The design is based more of the C FILE library than on the C++ iostream library.
    <ul>
      <li>The C++ iostream library is a tedious hierarchy of templated classes based on what data type you are working with. This is not how IO is done in practice. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Separating input from ouput (like the C++ istream and ostream classes) has been tried in the past and it just makes things messy.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> EAStream uses the size_type and off_type data types instead of directly using  built-in C++ data types in order to provide portability to 64 bit IO systems within 32 addressing systems. </li>
  <li>IStreams do not guarantee thread-safety. Unless a particular subclass explicitly guarantees thread safety, access to an IStream object from multiple threads must be coordinated by the user at a higher level, usually with a Mutex. </li>
  <li>IStreams are reference counted. This allows them to be passed around and shared, which in practice often happens, particularly when <a href="EAStreamAdapter.html">adapater streams</a> are in use.</li>
  <li>IStreams are not currently EACOM objects, though there might be some advantage to having them be so. Primarily, they would get an AsInterface function which would provide for dynamic type identification. </li>
  <li>The IStream interface includes SetSize and SetPosition functions, even though the underlying stream may not have random access. This is done because the simplicity of having a single interace for all stream IO is deemed to outweigh other considerations. A stream without random access is advised to simply return false with these two functions and to document that it is not random access and thus cannot be used in such situations. </li>
  <li>There is a Close function, but no Open function. It is deemed that all streams are universally closable, but not universally openable. Specific IStream implementations can provide an Open function if that's a useful thing. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>We list some best practices regarding stream usage.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Systems should agree on how ownership of streams is managed. It's often best if the entity that opens a stream also closes it. </li>
  <li>If you want to declare a stream object on the stack, consider AddRefing it before passing it to others who might AddRef/Release it.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Subclassing IStream </h2>
<p> We will discuss two ways of extending the IStream interface: subclassing and adapting. In this section we cover subclassing, and in the next we cover adapting. </p>
<p>Subclassing an IStream is probably best described by example. In the class below we have a <a href="EAFileStream.html">FileStream</a>, which implements the IStream interface for disk files. The code that's highlighed in <span class="style1">blue</span> is the new code added by the FileStream class on top of what already exists in IStream. </p>
<pre class="code-example">class FileStream : public IStream
{
public:
<span class="style1">    enum Type
    { 
        kTypeFileStream = 0x34722300
    };
 
    enum Share
    {
        kShareNone   = 0x00,     /// No sharing.
        kShareRead   = 0x01,     /// Allow sharing for reading.
        kShareWrite  = 0x02,     /// Allow sharing for writing.
        kShareDelete = 0x04      /// Allow sharing for deletion.
    };
 
    enum UsageHints
    {
        kUsageHintNone       = 0x00,
        kUsageHintSequential = 0x01,
        kUsageHintRandom     = 0x02
    };
</span> 
public:
<span class="style1">    FileStream(const char* pPath8 = NULL);
    FileStream(const char16_t* pPath16);
</span> 
<span class="style1">    // FileStream
    // Does not copy information related to an open file, such as the file handle.
    FileStream(const FileStream& fs);
</span>
    virtual ~FileStream();

<span class="style1">    // operator=
    // Does not copy information related to an open file, such as the file handle.
    FileStream& operator=(const FileStream& fs);
</span>
    virtual int       AddRef();
    virtual int       Release();

<span class="style1">    virtual void      SetPath(const char* pPath8);
    virtual void      SetPath(const char16_t* pPath16);
    virtual size_t    GetPath(char* pPath8, size_t nPathLength);
    virtual size_t    GetPath(char16_t* pPath16, size_t nPathLength);

    virtual bool      Open(int nAccessFlags = kAccessFlagRead, int nCreationDisposition = kCDDefault,
                           int nSharing = kShareRead, int nUsageHints = kUsageHintNone); 
</span>    virtual bool      Close();
    virtual uint32_t  GetType() const { return kTypeFileStream; }
    virtual int       GetAccessFlags() const;
    virtual int       GetState() const;

    virtual size_type GetSize() const;
    virtual bool      SetSize(size_type size);

    virtual off_type  GetPosition(PositionType positionType = kPositionTypeBegin) const;
    virtual bool      SetPosition(off_type position, PositionType positionType = kPositionTypeBegin);

    virtual size_type GetAvailable() const;

    virtual size_type Read(void* pData, size_type nSize);
    virtual bool      Write(const void* pData, size_type nSize);
    virtual bool      Flush();
};</pre>
<p>The UTF provides a formal <a href="EAFileStream.html">FileStream</a> class like the one above. Other subclasses of IStream are implemented in the UTF, including a few in the ResourceMan module. Also of note is <a href="EAStreamMemory.html">MemoryStream</a>, which turns an arbitrary block of memory into an IStream. </p>
<h2>Adapting IStream </h2>
<p> Another way to extend IStreams is to <em>adapt</em> them. By this we mean write a wrapper around them instead of subclass them. The strength of adapters is that they can be bound to a stream dynamically and thus impart their functionality onto any other stream, including other stream adapters. We discuss two types of adapaters here: class-based adapters and function-based adapters.</p>
<p>Here is an example of an adapter found in <a href="EAStreamChild.html">EAStreamChild</a>. Note the code in <span class="style1">blue</span>, which is related to the StreamChild adapting another stream: </p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-example-comment">/// StreamChild
///
/// Implements a fixed-size read-only stream which is a 'child' of a parent
/// stream. This is useful if you have a system whereby a single large file
/// consists of smaller files or a single large database record consists of
/// multiple sub-records and you want each sub-record to look like a standalone
/// stream to the user.
</span> 
class StreamChild : public IStream
{
public:
    enum { kTypeStreamChild = 0x3472233a };

    StreamChild(<span class="style1">IStream* pStreamParent = NULL</span>, size_type nPosition = 0, size_type nSize = 0);
   ~StreamChild();

    int       AddRef();
    int       Release();
    <span class="style1">bool      Open(IStream* pStreamParent, size_type nPosition, size_type nSize);</span>
    bool      Close();
    uint32_t  GetType() const { return kTypeStreamChild; }
    int       GetAccessFlags() const;
    int       GetState() const;
    size_type GetSize() const;
    bool      SetSize(size_type);
    off_type  GetPosition(PositionType positionType = kPositionTypeBegin) const;
    bool      SetPosition(off_type position, PositionType positionType = kPositionTypeBegin);

    size_type GetAvailable() const;
    size_type Read(void* pData, size_type nSize);

    bool      Flush();
    bool      Write(const void* pData, size_type nSize);

protected:
    int         mnRefCount;
    int         mnAccessFlags;
    <span class="style1">IStream*    mpStreamParent;</span>
    size_type   mnPositionParent;                
    size_type   mnPosition;
    size_type   mnSize;
};</pre>
<p>Other class adapters provided by the UTF include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="EACompression.html">CompressionStream</a>  -- Makes a unique stream out of a segment within another stream.</li>

  <li><a href="EAStreamBuffer.html">BufferedStream</a> -- Provides smart stream buffering (better than what you get with the C/C++ standard libraries).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of some of the function adapters found in <a href="EAStreamAdapter.html">EAStreamAdapter</a>:</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-example-comment">// Read a uint32_t and converts it from big endian to whatever local endian is.
